# AGENTS.md

Guidance for AI coding agents working in this repository. This is the same
content as [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) — kept here for tools that look for `AGENTS.md`.
The authoritative, modular rules live under [`.claude/`](.claude/).

This repo is a **polyglot Bun-workspace monorepo**: a Go backend (`apps/api`), a
React + Tauri client (`apps/web`), and a LangGraph.js service (`apps/ai`), sharing
one proto contract (`contract/`). Rules below target `apps/api` (the Go backend)
unless noted; start with
[rules/project-overview.md](.claude/rules/project-overview.md).

## Rules (`.claude/rules/`)

| Rule | Covers |
|------|--------|
| [project-overview](.claude/rules/project-overview.md) | Stack, monorepo layout, root Bun scripts |
| [architecture](.claude/rules/architecture.md) | Go backend layers, generated routes, data flow |
| [codebase-conventions](.claude/rules/codebase-conventions.md) | Fail-fast config, fail-closed auth, protojson responses |
| [coding-standards](.claude/rules/coding-standards.md) | File org, naming, errors, context, interfaces |
| [goroutines](.claude/rules/goroutines.md) | Leaks, races, deadlocks, worker pools, panics |
| [database](.claude/rules/database.md) | GORM usage, transactions, connection pool |
| [redis](.claude/rules/redis.md) | Redigo connection pooling |
| [testing](.claude/rules/testing.md) | Table-driven tests, mocks, race detection |
| [logging](.claude/rules/logging.md) | Structured Zap logging, no secrets |
| [security](.claude/rules/security.md) | OWASP Top 10 with Go examples |
| [api-responses](.claude/rules/api-responses.md) | Success / error / pagination envelopes |
| [commands](.claude/rules/commands.md) | Common `make` / `bun` commands |
| [code-review-checklist](.claude/rules/code-review-checklist.md) | Pre-PR checklist |

## Agents (`.claude/agents/`)

- [code-reviewer](.claude/agents/code-reviewer.md) — reviews Go changes against these rules before a PR.

## Skills (`.claude/skills/`)

- [proto-routes](.claude/skills/proto-routes/SKILL.md) — add/change a REST+gRPC endpoint via the proto contract, then `make proto`.

## Quick rules of thumb

- **REST routes are generated** — change `contract/<svc>/<svc>.proto` and run
  `make proto`; never hand-edit Fiber routes or the auth map.
- **Auth is fail-closed** — every route/RPC needs an explicit policy or the server
  panics at startup.
- **golang-migrate is authoritative** — schema changes go through SQL migrations.
- **Always** `go test -race ./...` for new behavior; never log secrets.

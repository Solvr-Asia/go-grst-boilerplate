# Claude Code Guidelines for Go-GRST-Boilerplate

This file is the **index** for AI-assistant guidance. The detailed standards,
rules, agents, and skills live under [`.claude/`](.claude/) so each concern is a
small, focused file. Read the rule that matches the task; treat these as
authoritative for `apps/api` (the Go backend).

> This repo is a **polyglot Bun-workspace monorepo** — a Go backend (`apps/api`),
> a React + Tauri client (`apps/web`), and a Mastra.ai service (`apps/ai`),
> sharing one proto contract (`contract/`). Start with
> [rules/project-overview.md](.claude/rules/project-overview.md).

## Agents (`.claude/agents/`)

- [code-reviewer](.claude/agents/code-reviewer.md) — reviews Go changes against these rules before a PR.

## Skills (`.claude/skills/`)

- [proto-routes](.claude/skills/proto-routes/SKILL.md) — add/change a REST+gRPC endpoint via the proto contract, then `make proto`.
